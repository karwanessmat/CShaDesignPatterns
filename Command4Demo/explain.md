Let's break down the code into ordered steps, with a description and the corresponding code snippet for each step.

### Step 1: Define the Command Interface
The `ICommand` interface declares methods for executing a command, checking if a command can be executed, and undoing a command. This interface is the foundation for all concrete command classes.

```csharp
public interface ICommand
{
    void Execute();
    bool CanExecute();
    void Undo();
}
```

### Step 2: Implement Concrete Commands
Concrete commands implement the `ICommand` interface and define specific actions, such as adding a product to the cart, changing the quantity of a product, removing all items from the cart, and removing a specific item from the cart.

#### Add to Cart Command
This command adds a product to the shopping cart and decreases the stock of the product.

```csharp
public class AddToCardCommand : ICommand
{
    public void Execute()
    {
        // Logic to add a product to the shopping cart
    }

    public bool CanExecute()
    {
        // Check if the command can be executed
    }

    public void Undo()
    {
        // Logic to undo the add to cart action
    }
}
```

#### Change Quantity Command
This command changes the quantity of a specific product in the shopping cart.

```csharp
public class ChangeQuantityCommand : ICommand
{
    public void Execute()
    {
        // Logic to change the quantity of a product in the cart
    }

    public bool CanExecute()
    {
        // Check if the command can be executed
    }

    public void Undo()
    {
        // Logic to undo the change in quantity
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Define Repositories
Repositories manage the data for products and shopping carts, allowing commands to query and update product stock and cart contents.

#### Product Repository
Manages the product stock and provides methods to increase or decrease stock.

```csharp
public class ProductsRepository : IProductRepository
{
    public void DecreaseStockBy(string articleId, int amount)
    {
        // Logic to decrease the stock of a product
    }

    public void IncreaseStockBy(string articleId, int amount)
    {
        // Logic to increase the stock of a product
    }
}
```

#### Shopping Cart Repository
Manages the shopping cart and provides methods to add, remove, and update items in the cart.

```csharp
public class ShoppingCartRepository : IShoppingCartRepository
{
    public void Add(Product product)
    {
        // Logic to add a product to the cart
    }

    public void RemoveAll(string articleId)
    {
        // Logic to remove all instances of a product from the cart
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Implement the Invoker
The `CommandManager` class acts as an invoker, managing the execution and undoing of commands.

```csharp
public class CommandManager
{
    private readonly Stack<ICommand> _commands = new();

    public void Invoke(ICommand command)
    {
        // Execute the command if possible and add it to the stack
    }

    public void Undo()
    {
        // Undo commands by popping them from the stack
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Execute Commands
In the main execution logic, repositories are instantiated, commands are created with these repositories, and then executed using the command manager.

```csharp
var shoppingCartRepository = new ShoppingCartRepository();
var productsRepository = new ProductsRepository();

var product = productsRepository.FindBy("4");
var addToCartCommand = new AddToCardCommand(shoppingCartRepository, productsRepository, product);

var manager = new CommandManager();
manager.Invoke(addToCartCommand);
```

### Step 6: Undo Operations
Commands that have been executed can be undone through the command manager.

```csharp
manager.Undo();
```

Each of these steps demonstrates a part of the Command design pattern, from defining the command structure, implementing concrete commands, managing data with repositories, executing commands through an invoker, and finally undoing commands if necessary.
