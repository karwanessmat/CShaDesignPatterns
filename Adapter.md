# Adapter Pattern

## Overview
The Adapter pattern allows two incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts like a bridge, translating interactions from one interface to an interface another system can understand.

## Description
"We use the Adapter class to write logic inside its methods that bridges the gap between incompatible objects, allowing them to work together effectively."

### Example C# Code for Adapter Class
```csharp
public interface ITarget
{
    void Request(); // Expected operations
}

public class Adapter : ITarget
{
    private readonly Adaptee _adaptee;

    public Adapter(Adaptee adaptee)
    {
        _adaptee = adaptee;
    }

    public void Request()
    {
        _adaptee.SpecificRequest();
    }
}
```

## Adaptee
"The Adaptee can be thought of as the source or API that your system needs to interact with. You use the Adapter to convert or adapt this source so it fits with your system's expectations and interfaces."

### Example C# Code for Adaptee
```csharp
public class Adaptee
{
    public void SpecificRequest()
    {
        // Specific request that is not compatible with the client's system
        Console.WriteLine("Specific request being processed...");
    }
}
```

## Special Considerations
- "We use the Adapter class as a place to implement logic that bridges the gap between incompatible objects, allowing them to work together inside a implemented adapter interface method."
- "The Adaptee can be thought of as the source or API that your system needs to interact with. You use the Adapter to convert or adapt this source so it fits with your system's expectations and interfaces."

### Example C# Code for Adapter with Special Consideration
```csharp
public class Adapter : ITarget
{
    private Adaptee _adaptee;

    public Adapter(Adaptee adaptee)
    {
        _adaptee = adaptee;
    }

    public object ConvertMethod()
    {
        // We are using here to convert a data from adaptee data to our system object.
    }
}
```

## Usage
Here is how you might use the Adapter in your system:

### Example C# Code for Using the Adapter
```csharp
class Client
{
    public void Main()
    {
        Adaptee adaptee = new Adaptee();
        ITarget target = new Adapter(adaptee);
        target.Request();
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
The Adapter pattern is essential for integrating new components with incompatible interfaces into existing systems without altering their code. By implementing a middle-layer that functions as a translator, systems can extend their operations to work with previously incompatible external libraries or APIs.
