# Chain of Responsibility Pattern Implementation

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Chain of Responsibility design pattern in C#. The pattern allows an object to send a command without knowing which object will handle the request. This creates a chain of objects that can act upon the request.

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (version 6.0 or later)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Build the project using the .NET CLI command: `dotnet build`.
4. Run the project using the command: `dotnet run`.

## Implementation Details

### Step 1: Define the Handler Interface

The handler interface declares methods for setting the next handler in the chain and handling requests.

```csharp
public interface IHandler
{
    IHandler SetNext(IHandler handler);
    void Handle(string request);
}
```

### Step 2: Implement Concrete Handlers

Concrete handlers implement the handler interface and define how they handle requests.

```csharp
public class ConcreteHandler1 : IHandler
{
    private IHandler _nextHandler;

    public IHandler SetNext(IHandler handler)
    {
        _nextHandler = handler;
        return handler;
    }

    public void Handle(string request)
    {
        if (request == "Condition1")
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Handled by ConcreteHandler1");
        }
        else
        {
            _nextHandler?.Handle(request);
        }
    }
}

public class ConcreteHandler2 : IHandler
{
    private IHandler _nextHandler;

    public IHandler SetNext(IHandler handler)
    {
        _nextHandler = handler;
        return handler;
    }

    public void Handle(string request)
    {
        if (request == "Condition2")
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Handled by ConcreteHandler2");
        }
        else
        {
            _nextHandler?.Handle(request);
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Client Configuration

The client sets up the chain of handlers and initiates the request to be handled.

```csharp
class Client
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var handler1 = new ConcreteHandler1();
        var handler2 = new ConcreteHandler2();

        handler1.SetNext(handler2);

        handler1.Handle("Condition2"); // This request will be passed to and handled by ConcreteHandler2
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates the basic structure and implementation of the Chain of Responsibility pattern in C#. The pattern is useful for creating a pipeline of handlers where a request can be passed along until it is processed by the appropriate handler.
