The State design pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. 
The object will appear to change its class.




Certainly! Below is a simple `README.md` structure and content based on the State Pattern as you described, divided into each section with explanations and a sample C# code implementation.

# State Pattern Implementation

## What is the State Pattern?
The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing as if it has changed its class. This pattern is particularly useful for managing the behavior of an object without the use of extensive conditional statements. Instead, state-specific behaviors are encapsulated within separate state objects.

### Frequency of use: `3/5` medium

## Real-World Scenario
Consider a Document Editor with multiple modes such as Editing, Reviewing, or ReadOnly. Each mode dictates how the document responds to user inputs:
- **Editing Mode**: Allows text modifications.
- **Reviewing Mode**: Tracks changes for approval or rejection.
- **ReadOnly Mode**: Disallows any modifications.
Using the State Pattern, each mode's behavior is encapsulated in separate state objects, simplifying the main editor code and enhancing extendibility.

## Problem
In systems where an object's behavior varies according to its state, managing this behavior with conditional statements (like if-else or switch-case) becomes cumbersome and error-prone as the system evolves. This traditional approach complicates maintenance and violates the Open/Closed Principle of software design.

## Solution to the Problem
The State Pattern addresses these issues by encapsulating state-specific behaviors into separate classes, each implementing a common interface. This allows dynamic behavior changes through internal state transitions without modifying the object's structure, thus adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

## State Pattern Structure
1. **State Interface**: A common interface for all states, typically containing methods to handle requests.
2. **Concrete States**: Classes that implement the State interface and perform state-specific behaviors.
3. **Context**: A class that maintains a reference to a state object representing the current state, delegating state-specific tasks to this object.

## Steps to Implement the State Pattern
1. **Define the State Interface**:
   - Create an interface declaring methods for actions the object can perform.

```csharp
public interface IState
{
    void Handle(Context context);
}
```

2. **Create Concrete State Classes**:
   - Implement the State interface in classes that represent specific states.

```csharp
public class EditingState : IState
{
    public void Handle(Context context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Document is in Editing mode.");
    }
}

public class ReviewingState : IState
{
    public void Handle(Context context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Document is in Reviewing mode.");
    }
}
```

3. **Develop the Context Class**:
   - Maintain a reference to the state object and delegate methods to it.

```csharp
public class Context
{
    private IState _state;

    public Context(IState state)
    {
        TransitionTo(state);
    }

    public void TransitionTo(IState state)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Context: Transition to {state.GetType().Name}");
        _state = state;
    }

    public void Request()
    {
        _state.Handle(this);
    }
}
```

4. **Integrate States with Context**:
   - Allow changing of state objects within the context as needed.

5. **Client Interaction**:
   - Clients interact with the context, which in turn uses the current state object to respond appropriately.

## Summary
The State Pattern offers a structured way to handle varying behaviors based on the internal states of an object, promoting cleaner and more manageable code. This pattern helps maintain the Open/Closed Principle, allowing new states to be added with minimal changes to the existing codebase.
