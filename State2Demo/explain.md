### Code Analysis and Description

#### State Interface and Concrete State Classes

1. **Abstract State Class** (`State`):
   - Defines an abstract base for state-specific behavior.
   - Contains common properties like `Interest`, `LowerLimit`, `UpperLimit`, and methods `Deposit()`, `Withdraw()`, `PayInterest()` which are overridden in derived states.

2. **RedState Class**:
   - Represents an overdrawn state of the account.
   - Implements the state-specific behaviors for operations like deposits, which may transition the state, and withdrawals, which are blocked with a service fee charged.

3. **SilverState Class**:
   - Default state for new accounts, not overdrawn but below a luxury threshold.
   - Implements behaviors for deposits, withdrawals, and interest payments, with state transitions to either "RedState" or "GoldState" based on the balance.

4. **GoldState Class** (not implemented in the provided code but implied):
   - Would represent a state for high-balance accounts.
   - Expected to have its own implementations for `Deposit()`, `Withdraw()`, and `PayInterest()` that handle higher balance thresholds.

#### Context Class

5. **Account Class**:
   - Acts as the "Context" in the State Pattern.
   - Contains properties for the account owner and the current state.
   - Delegates state-dependent behavior to the `State` object.

#### Main Program Class

6. **Program Class**:
   - Contains the `Main` method where the state pattern is demonstrated through an example account.
   - Shows transitions through different states based on financial transactions like deposits and withdrawals.

### Step-by-Step Guide for Implementing State Pattern

#### Implementing the Abstract State Class

```csharp
public abstract class State
{
    protected double Interest;
    protected double LowerLimit;
    protected double UpperLimit;
    public double Balance { get; set; }
    public Account Account { get; set; }

    public abstract void Deposit(double amount);
    public abstract void Withdraw(double amount);
    public abstract void PayInterest();
}
```

#### Implementing Concrete States

```csharp
public class RedState : State
{
    private double _serviceFee;

    public RedState(State state)
    {
        this.Balance = state.Balance;
        this.Account = state.Account;
        Initialize();
    }

    private void Initialize()
    {
        Interest = 0.0;
        LowerLimit = -100.0;
        UpperLimit = 0.0;
        _serviceFee = 15.00;
    }

    public override void Deposit(double amount)
    {
        Balance += amount;
        StateChangeCheck();
    }

    public override void Withdraw(double amount)
    {
        amount = amount - _serviceFee;
        Console.WriteLine("No funds available for withdrawal!");
    }

    public override void PayInterest()
    {
        // No interest is paid
    }

    private void StateChangeCheck()
    {
        if (Balance > UpperLimit)
        {
            Account.State = new SilverState(this);
        }
    }
}
```



## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the State Design Pattern within a simple banking application scenario. It models an account that can have multiple states (Red, Silver, Gold) affecting its behavior for transactions like deposits and withdrawals.

## Implementation
- `State`: An abstract class representing the shared behavior and properties of various states.
- `RedState`, `SilverState`, `GoldState`: Concrete classes that implement behaviors specific to each state.
- `Account`: The context class that maintains an instance of `State` to delegate state-specific behavior.
- `Program`: The entry point of the application, showcasing the usage of the context and states.
