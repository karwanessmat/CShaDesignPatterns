## A structural design pattern is a type of design pattern that helps to arrange objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. Essentially, it's like creating a blueprint for how different parts of a program fit together to form a larger, organized system.

Types of structural design patterns include:

1. **Adapter Pattern**: This pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts like a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.
2. **Bridge Pattern**: It separates an object’s interface from its implementation, so the two can vary independently. It's like having two layers of abstraction.
3. **Composite Pattern**: This pattern lets you compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
4. **Decorator Pattern**: It allows adding new functionalities to objects without altering their structure through subclassing. It’s like wrapping the original object with new features.
5. **Facade Pattern**: It provides a simplified interface to a complex system, making it easier to use by hiding its complexities.
6. **Flyweight Pattern**: It's used to minimize memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with similar objects; it’s about sharing to save resources.
7. **Proxy Pattern**: This pattern provides a placeholder for another object to control access to it, like a protective layer over the object.

Structural design patterns are used to define and simplify the relationships between different components of a software system, making it easier to build and scale complex systems.
