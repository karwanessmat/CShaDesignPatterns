To create a detailed `README.md` for the given Bridge design pattern implementation in C#, we will structure it with sections explaining the purpose of the pattern, the structure of the code, and how to run the example.

# Bridge Design Pattern in C#

## Introduction
The Bridge design pattern is a structural design pattern that separates the abstraction (high-level logic) from the implementation (low-level logic), allowing them to be developed independently. This pattern is used to decouple an interface from its implementation so that they can vary independently.

## Implementation Details

### Components
The implementation consists of the following components:

- **Abstraction (`Shape`)**: An abstract class that defines the interface for the high-level part of the two class hierarchies. It contains a reference to the implementor.
- **Refined Abstraction (`Circle`)**: Extends the interface defined by `Shape` and is the concrete implementation of the abstraction.
- **Implementor (`IDraw`)**: An interface that defines the interface for the low-level part of the two class hierarchies. It provides the methods to be implemented.
- **Concrete Implementor (`GreenCircle`, `RedCircle`)**: Implements the `IDraw` interface and defines the concrete implementation of an interface defined by `IDraw`.

### Code Structure
- `Shape` is an abstract class that holds a reference to `IDraw`. It defines an abstract method `Draw()`.
- `Circle` is a concrete class that extends `Shape` and implements the `Draw()` method.
- `IDraw` is an interface that defines the method `DrawCircle()`.
- `GreenCircle` and `RedCircle` are concrete classes that implement `IDraw`, providing specific implementations of `DrawCircle()` method.

### How It Works
- `Shape` acts as an abstraction and does not implement the drawing logic itself but delegates the drawing logic to the `DrawApi` (an instance of `IDraw`).
- `Circle` provides the properties necessary for its drawing (`Radius`, `X`, and `Y`) and implements the `Draw()` method by calling `DrawCircle()` on its `DrawApi`.
- `GreenCircle` and `RedCircle` provide the implementation for `DrawCircle()` method, where each class can draw the circle in a different color.

## Usage

### Running the Example
1. Create a new C# console project in your preferred IDE or editor.
2. Copy the provided code into the main program file.
3. Build and run the program.

### Expected Output
When you run the program, it should display the following output, indicating that circles of different colors are being drawn:

```
Red Circle with size radius: 5, x: 10, y: 10
Green Circle with size radius: 20, x: 10, y: 10
```

These messages are generated by the `DrawCircle()` method in `GreenCircle` and `RedCircle` classes, showing that the circle drawing logic is separated from the `Circle` class through the Bridge pattern.



In the provided Bridge design pattern example in C#, the roles of the components can be described as follows:

1. **Abstraction Layer (Interface)**: There isn't a direct "interface" for the abstraction layer in this example. However, the `Shape` abstract class acts as the abstraction in the pattern. It defines the high-level interface for the shapes.

2. **Implementation Layer**: The `IDraw` interface represents the implementation layer. This interface defines the method(s) that the concrete implementations will provide, such as `DrawCircle()`.

3. **Bridge**: The bridge in this context is the link between the abstraction and the implementation layers, which is represented by the `DrawApi` member in the `Shape` class. It holds a reference to the `IDraw` interface, allowing the abstraction to use the implementation methods.

4. **Refined Abstractions**: The `Circle` class is the refined abstraction. It extends the `Shape` class and provides more specific implementations of the abstraction, such as defining the circle's radius and its draw method.
