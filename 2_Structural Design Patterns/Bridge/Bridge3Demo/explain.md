# Bridge Design Pattern Example

## Overview
The Bridge design pattern is used to separate the abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to be developed independently. This pattern involves an interface that acts as a bridge between the abstraction and implementation layers.

## Implementation

### Abstraction Layer
The `Shape` abstract class acts as the abstraction layer. It defines the interface for the shapes and holds a reference to the implementation (`IColor`).

```csharp
public abstract class Shape
{
    protected IColor Color;

    protected Shape(IColor color)
    {
        Color = color;
    }

    public abstract void SetColor();
}
```

### Implementation Layer
The `IColor` interface represents the implementation layer. It defines the method that will be implemented by concrete color classes.

```csharp
public interface IColor
{
    void Color();
}
```

### Bridge
The bridge is represented by the `Color` field in the `Shape` class, linking the abstraction with the implementation.

```csharp
protected IColor Color;
```

### Refined Abstractions
Classes such as `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Sequre` extend `Shape` and provide specific implementations of the `SetColor()` method.

```csharp
internal class Circle : Shape
{
    public Circle(IColor color) : base(color) { }

    public override void SetColor()
    {
        Console.Write("Circle ");
        Color.Color();
    }
}

class Rectangle : Shape
{
    public Rectangle(IColor color) : base(color) { }

    public override void SetColor()
    {
        Console.Write("Rectangle ");
        Color.Color();
    }
}

public class Sequre : Shape
{
    public Sequre(IColor color) : base(color) { }

    public override void SetColor()
    {
        Console.Write("Sequre ");
        Color.Color();
    }
}
```

### Concrete Implementors
Concrete classes like `GreenColor` and `RedColor` implement the `IColor` interface, providing specific color functionalities.

```csharp
internal class GreenColor : IColor
{
    public void Color()
    {
        Console.Write("Green ");
    }
}

internal class RedColor : IColor
{
    public void Color()
    {
        Console.Write("Red ");
    }
}
```

## Usage Example

In the main method, instances of the refined abstraction classes are created with specific implementors, demonstrating the bridge pattern.

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Shape circle = new Circle(new RedColor());
    Shape sequre = new Sequre(new GreenColor());

    circle.SetColor();  // Outputs: Circle Red
    sequre.SetColor();  // Outputs: Sequre Green

    Console.ReadKey();
}
```

## Conclusion

This example illustrates the Bridge design pattern in C#, demonstrating how it can be used to separate the abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently.
