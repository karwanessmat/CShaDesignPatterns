# Behavioral Design Patterns 🔄

Behavioral design patterns are essential in software development, focusing on the interaction and responsibility distribution among objects. These patterns enhance communication and data flow, improving the flexibility of interactions within software systems.

## Overview

These patterns are crucial for creating software that efficiently manages communication and responsibilities between objects, ensuring that complex systems are more maintainable and scalable.

---
---

### Chain of Responsibility Pattern 🔗  `2/5`
- **Definition**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers, where each handler can process the request or forward it to the next handler.
- **Use Case**: Processing different types of document approvals in an organizational workflow.

---
---

### Strategy Pattern 📊
- **Definition**: Enables the selection of an algorithm's behavior at runtime by encapsulating each one, allowing them to be interchangeable.
- **Use Case**: Changing the sorting behavior of a list based on user preferences.

---
--- 

### Observer Pattern 👀
- **Definition**: Establishes a one-to-many relationship between objects, notifying and updating dependents automatically when one changes state.
- **Use Case**: Updating multiple display elements when data in a sensor system changes.

---
---

### State Pattern 🔄
- **Definition**: Allows an object to alter its behavior based on its internal state, giving the illusion of object class change.
- **Use Case**: Changing the modes of a user interface based on user interactions.

---
---

### Template Method Pattern 📝
- **Definition**: Outlines the program skeleton in a method, deferring certain steps to subclasses, while maintaining the algorithm’s structure.
- **Use Case**: Defining the structure of a data processing algorithm while allowing subclasses to provide detailed implementation.

---
---

###  Command Pattern 🖱️
- **Definition**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby facilitating the parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations supporting undo functionality.
- **Use Case**: Implementing redo-undo functionality in a text editor.

---
---

### Iterator Pattern 🔄
- **Definition**: Facilitates sequential access to elements of an aggregate object without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Use Case**: Navigating through a collection of files in a file system.

---
---

### Mediator Pattern 🤝
- **Definition**: Encapsulates how a set of objects interact, reducing direct communications between objects and establishing loose coupling.
- **Use Case**: Managing interactions between different GUI components in an application.

---
---

### Memento Pattern 💾
- **Definition**: Allows an object to save and restore its state, without revealing the specifics of its encapsulation.
- **Use Case**: Implementing save and restore functionality in a gaming application.

---
---

### Visitor Pattern 🚶
- **Definition**: Permits operations to be applied on a set of objects at runtime, separating operations from the object structure.
- **Use Case**: Applying different operations on a set of documents depending on their type.

---
---

### Interpreter Pattern 📖
- **Definition**: Implements a specialized language, interpreting sentences in the language by following the grammar rules.
- **Use Case**: Developing a simple SQL-like query language for custom data filtering.

---
---

### Null Object Pattern 🚫
- **Definition**: Utilizes an object with specified neutral behavior instead of `null`, reducing the risk of null reference errors.
- **Use Case**: Handling absence of user data gracefully in user interface elements.

These patterns offer structured and efficient ways to manage object interactions, making them foundational for creating well-organized and scalable software systems.
