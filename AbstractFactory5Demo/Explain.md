# Abstract Factory Design Pattern Example

## Overview
The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that helps in creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. It involves an interface responsible for creating a set of related objects, or families, without explicitly specifying their classes.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Identify Product Families
Assume we're building UI components that include Buttons and Text Boxes. We have two themes: Light and Dark.

### Step 2: Create Abstract Products
Define interfaces for the UI components, abstracting out the specifics of the concrete products.

```csharp
// Abstract Product for Buttons
public interface IButton
{
    void Display();
}

// Abstract Product for Text Boxes
public interface ITextBox
{
    void Display();
}
```

### Step 3: Declare the Abstract Factory
Create an interface that will declare methods for creating each of the abstract products.

```csharp
// Abstract Factory for creating UI components
public interface IUIFactory
{
    IButton CreateButton();
    ITextBox CreateTextBox();
}
```

### Step 4: Create Concrete Factories
Implement the abstract factory interface with specific classes for each theme.

```csharp
// Concrete Factory for Light Theme UI components
public class LightThemeFactory : IUIFactory
{
    public IButton CreateButton() => new LightButton();
    public ITextBox CreateTextBox() => new LightTextBox();
}

// Concrete Factory for Dark Theme UI components
public class DarkThemeFactory : IUIFactory
{
    public IButton CreateButton() => new DarkButton();
    public ITextBox CreateTextBox() => new DarkTextBox();
}
```

### Step 5: Create Concrete Products
Implement the products that are specific to each theme.

```csharp
// Concrete Product for Light-themed Button
public class LightButton : IButton
{
    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Displaying a light-themed button.");
    }
}

// Concrete Product for Light-themed Text Box
public class LightTextBox : ITextBox
{
    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Displaying a light-themed text box.");
    }
}

// Concrete Product for Dark-themed Button
public class DarkButton : IButton
{
    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Displaying a dark-themed button.");
    }
}

// Concrete Product for Dark-themed Text Box
public class DarkTextBox : ITextBox
{
    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Displaying a dark-themed text box.");
    }
}
```

### Step 6: Configure Application with a Factory
Use the factories to create UI components within the client code.

```csharp
// Client code
public class Application
{
    private IButton _button;
    private ITextBox _textBox;

    public Application(IUIFactory factory)
    {
        _button = factory.CreateButton();
        _textBox = factory.CreateTextBox();
    }

    public void Render()
    {
        _button.Display();
        _textBox.Display();
    }
}
```

### Step 7: Instantiate and Use
Decide which factory to use and create an application instance with that factory.

```csharp
// Application entry point
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        IUIFactory lightFactory = new LightThemeFactory();
        Application appLight = new Application(lightFactory);
        appLight.Render();

        IUIFactory darkFactory = new DarkThemeFactory();
        Application appDark = new Application(darkFactory);
        appDark.Render();
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
By following the steps outlined above, we have created an application with a flexible and extendable structure using the Abstract Factory design pattern. This approach follows the Open/Closed Principle, allowing for easy adaptation to new themes without changing the client code.
