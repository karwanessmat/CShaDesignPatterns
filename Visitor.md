# Visitor Pattern Implementation in C#

## Introduction
The Visitor pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to perform operations on elements of an object structure without changing the classes of the elements. It is especially useful for adding new operations to existing class hierarchies without modifying those classes.

## How the Visitor Pattern Works
- **Visitor Interface**: This interface defines a set of visit methods, which are tailored to work with various concrete element classes. Each method's purpose is to handle operations specific to an element of the corresponding class.
- **Concrete Visitors**: These are classes that implement the Visitor interface. Each class can perform operations across different sets of element objects.
- **Element Interface**: An interface that declares an `Accept` method, which takes a visitor object as an argument. This method allows the visitor to access the element's class and thus perform the relevant operations.
- **Concrete Elements**: Classes implementing the Element interface. Each class must provide its own implementation of the `Accept` method, which typically involves calling the visit method of the visitor for its object.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Define Visitors:**
   Create new visitor classes implementing the `IVisitor` interface. Each visitor should define what it does for each kind of element it can visit.

2. **Create Elements:**
   Define new element classes implementing the `IElement` interface. Each element class must implement an `Accept` method that accepts a visitor and allows it to perform its operation.

3. **Execute Visitors on Elements:**
   In your client code (typically in the `Main` method), instantiate your elements and visitors, and have the elements accept the visitors.

Example:
```csharp
var elements = new List<IElement>
{
    new ConcreteElementA(),
    new ConcreteElementB()
};

var visitor1 = new ConcreteVisitor1();
var visitor2 = new ConcreteVisitor2();

foreach (var element in elements)
{
    element.Accept(visitor1);
    element.Accept(visitor2);
}
```
