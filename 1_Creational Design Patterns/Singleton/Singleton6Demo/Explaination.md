# Service Configuration Manager

The `ServiceConfigurationManager` is a Singleton class that manages service configurations for an application across different environments, such as Development, Staging, and Production. It ensures that all parts of the application can access consistent configuration settings, and it loads these settings from a designated source only once, improving efficiency and maintainability.

## Features

- Single instance across the application.
- Thread-safe implementation.
- Supports multiple environments.
- Easy retrieval of configuration settings.
- Exception handling for missing configurations.

## How It Works

The configuration manager uses a private constructor and a static instance method to ensure a single instance. It contains a dictionary that maps environments to their corresponding service configuration settings.

## Usage

1. **Singleton Access**: Access the `ServiceConfigurationManager` instance using `ServiceConfigurationManager.Instance`.

2. **Retrieving Configurations**: Call `GetConfiguration` with the environment and configuration key to retrieve settings.

3. **Integration**: Integrate the configuration manager into services that require configuration settings, like `PaymentService`.

## Code Structure

- `ServiceConfigurationManager` class: The core Singleton class that manages configurations.
- `LoadDevelopmentConfigurations`, `LoadStagingConfigurations`, `LoadProductionConfigurations`: Methods to load configurations for each environment.
- `GetConfiguration`: Method to retrieve the configuration value for a given key and environment.
- `_serviceConfigurations`: A dictionary holding the configurations for each environment.
- `_instance`: The static variable holding the Singleton instance.
- `_lock`: An object used for thread synchronization to ensure that the Singleton instance is created only once.

## Implementation Details

- **Private Constructor**: The constructor is private to prevent direct instantiation.
- **Static Instance Property**: Provides global access to the single `ServiceConfigurationManager` instance.
- **Environment-Specific Configuration Methods**: Private methods that simulate loading environment-specific configurations.
- **Thread Safety**: Implemented using a lock to prevent multiple instantiations in multithreaded scenarios.

## Getting Started

To use the `ServiceConfigurationManager` in your application:

1. Determine the current environment and the configuration key you need.
2. Retrieve the configuration using `ServiceConfigurationManager.Instance.GetConfiguration(environment, key)`.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `ServiceConfigurationManager` within a `PaymentService`:

```csharp
class PaymentService
{
    private readonly string _apiKey;

    public PaymentService(string environment)
    {
        _apiKey = ServiceConfigurationManager.Instance.GetConfiguration(environment, "PaymentGatewayApiKey");
        // Use the _apiKey for payment transactions
    }

    public void ProcessPayment()
    {
        // Use the _apiKey to authenticate and process payments
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string currentEnvironment = "Production";
        PaymentService paymentService = new PaymentService(currentEnvironment);
        paymentService.ProcessPayment();
    }
}
