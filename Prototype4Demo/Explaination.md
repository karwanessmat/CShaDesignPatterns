# E-Commerce Project Using the Prototype Design Pattern

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the Prototype Design Pattern in an e-commerce application context. The Prototype pattern allows us to clone objects, creating new instances with the same properties, which is particularly useful when we have many similar objects with only minor differences.

## Prototype Design Pattern in E-Commerce

In our e-commerce application, we manage product listings. Products often have many shared attributes, and it's inefficient to create each product from scratch. The Prototype pattern helps us create new products by copying a prototype instance and only modifying the differing attributes.


## Running the Application

Execute the application from your development environment or via the command line if you're using .NET Core CLI with `dotnet run`. This will simulate the creation of product instances based on a prototype.

## Implementation Details

### Prototype Interface

A `IProductPrototype` interface defines the cloning contract for products.

```csharp
public interface IProductPrototype
{
    IProductPrototype Clone();
}
```

### Concrete Prototype

The `Product` class implements the `IProductPrototype` interface, allowing it to create new instances of `Product` with identical values.

```csharp
public class Product : IProductPrototype
{
    // Properties like Name, Price, Description, ImageUrl

    public IProductPrototype Clone()
    {
        // MemberwiseClone is used to create a shallow copy
    }
}
```

### Application Usage

In the main application, we create a prototype `Product` object and then clone it to create new product variations with minor changes.

```csharp
Product prototypeProduct = new Product("Basic T-Shirt", 19.99m, "A plain t-shirt", "/images/tshirt.png");

Product redTShirt = (Product)prototypeProduct.Clone();
redTShirt.Name = "Red T-Shirt";
redTShirt.ImageUrl = "/images/red-tshirt.png";

Product blueTShirt = (Product)prototypeProduct.Clone();
blueTShirt.Name = "Blue T-Shirt";
blueTShirt.ImageUrl = "/images/blue-tshirt.png";
```

By following the above instructions and understanding the code snippets, you can explore the Prototype Design Pattern's use in an e-commerce application.
